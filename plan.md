This is a a platform where you can upload your notes/books, put in your youtube tutorial, or paste in text and it would generate you custom notes based on 3 modes, Socrates / Aristotle / Plato - Socrates mode is for people who want to learn a new topic and they want the easiest explanations, they would like diagrams, they would like easy explanations, they would like examples. Aristotle mode is for people who are researchers, who want to go deep inside a topic, they want to see facts, see complex equations, interpretations, they might want to see research paper references on the same topics. Plato mode is for people who want to study for an exam and they want to learn the topic in a way through which they can pass the exam with good marks. A quiz section is also there, which would help in testing the user on the topic. So the user who generates these notes, will be able to see both the book view and the generated notes as a tabbed view in the center, on the left panel there will be file view, where the user will upload notes. And on the right panel, there will be a chat view, where you can switch between different models to chat with your notes and your book/notes, you can use complex reasoning models to understand the topic in complete details or you can use simple ones for explanations. Through this whole flow, whatever notes are generated and whatever material is preserved, can be made public by the user, through which others can benefit from this. There will be a notebook marketplace, where user can see notebooks of other users on the same topic, which would save them time and effort to make notes themselves and ask ai agent relevant questions and search for correct books and notes to make notes from. Good notebooks can be ranked based on the likes they get. People can also track their learnings through the Library feature, they can see whatever they have learnt in past, and they can generate flashcards and short notes to revise those topics. This way, we build a complete all in one platform for learning. The target consumers are College Students, Researchers, and Curious People who are interested in learning new things everytime.

I have given you the plan, the complete product, how it will work and the designs. You need to use shadcn components for the frontend. You need to use Clerk for the auth, you need to use Mongodb for the database.
